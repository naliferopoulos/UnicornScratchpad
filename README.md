# Unicorn Scratchpad

This project is a playground for me to play around with Unicorn.

### Files

- chall.s - The assembly of the test challenge. It manipulates some values in al and **out**'s them.
- solver.py - The solver I wrote, using Unicorn, to emulate the code execution while hooking the **out** instruction.

### Makefile Targets

- make build - Assembles the challenge.
- make solve - Runs the solver.
- make clean - Cleans the compiled binary.

### Why?

Because Unicorn is fun!
